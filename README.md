# Face-recognition-system
Machine Learning Project
Welcome to the Face Recognition Program repository! This project leverages advanced facial feature analysis to identify individuals based on input images. By comparing the facial features of an input image with a dataset of trained images, the program accurately determines the identity of the person in the image.

Features
Accurate Face Identification: Utilizes sophisticated algorithms to analyze and recognize facial features.
Training with Custom Images: Easily train the model with your own images for personalized recognition.
Real-time Analysis: Supports real-time face recognition from live camera feeds.
High Precision: Achieves high accuracy rates through advanced feature extraction and matching techniques.
